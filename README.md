  ## Description
  
  I needed a way to generate an HTML page that gave details about my project team.
  
  This program allows the user to generate an HTML file with information about the Manager, Engineers, and Interns of a project using a user's input from the terminal.
  
  Using inquirer within functions, it appeears that the menu loops over and over again when selecting between if the user wants to add another Engineer, Intern, or Finish, but it's actually multiple inquirer prompts.
  
  The HTML page uses both custom CSS and Tailwind to style the page.
